# WRF Forecast output visualization

Scripts and documentation to create visual output for a WRF model run.
Moving away from the ncar command language as announced [here](http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Pivot_to_Python/september_2019_update.shtml)
the main focus now stands on the usage of the corresponding python implementation for creating output from the WRF output results.
